Discord bot cherry is a personal project that fetches cryptocurrency prices from an API and displays them in a voice channel's name. 
It responds to two commands: /price {crypto} for getting current crypto prices and /nft {nft-collection-name} for retrieving NFT collection details on the Solana blockchain.
The bot supports autocomplete for commands to make it easier to find the right options. When using the /price command, it provides suggestions based on the cryptocurrency names you start typing, displaying matching choices for quicker selection. Similarly, the /nft command will autocomplete NFT collection names, helping you select from the top 100 collections.
